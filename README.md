# FOTA-GP
This is our graduation Project "Firmware Over The Air" . FOTA is a technology that enables the operating firmware of a device to be upgraded and updated wirelessly over the network (“over the air”) without the need to connect directly to the device. This saves businesses the time and money spent sending a technician to have each one of their devices physically upgraded or updated.
